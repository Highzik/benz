I created a benz folder, and in the folder has the following sub-folders which are: contact, scripts, services, styles, and supports
I created different files in the following sub-folders in the root folders
I created a link in the home page that can link me to different pages across the root folder
I created different branches and made changes in the branches and later merged them with the master branch
I encountered a merge in conflict, and I was able to manually tackle it.
I moved the main.js and main.css file into the styles and scripts folder respectively.
